# Online Portfolio

I have created my third online CV. This version is cleaner and looks more professional than my first two online CVs. There are 5 pages: landing page, about page, resume page which is my cv page, projects page and a contact page.

Each page has a constant navigation bar and footer. The links on the navigation bar have a cool hover effect. As the page loads there is a simple but real effective animation on the cover of the landing page. The landing page also contains cards which direct you to the other pages, an about section with a short description about me and a section with my contact details in css grids. The about pages has full description of who I am and the code languages that I am familair with. The CV page has my skills, work experience, academic history and a download button where you are able to download my full cv. 

The projects page contacts the websites I have worked on before and will continue to grow with cool and beautifully designed webpages for my future clients. The contact page contains the same content as the contact section on the landing page. It has a map of the area I stay and cool icon buttons.

This CV was created and designed by me. It is fully responsive and it is the beginning of many more beautiful sites.
